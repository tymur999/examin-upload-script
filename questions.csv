Although Image 2 shows Chinese women and children working in the rice fields, European labor systems also featured women and children agricultural laborers. However, the Chinese labor system involved free peasant and artisanal labor, while European labor systems were more likely to involve serfdom.  ","(B) Incorrect. Although European labor systems in the Americans in the period 1450 to 1750 focused on cash crops, and both images do not show Chinese farmers growing cash crops, this was not a feature of European labor systems before 1450. The Chinese labor system involved free peasant and artisanal labor, while European labor systems were more likely to involve serfdom.  ","(C) Incorrect. Although European labor systems allowed certain traders and artisans to acquire wealth in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, such traders and artisans did not dominate European labor systems. Also, both the Song and Yuan dynasties also featured powerful and prosperous artisans.

Monsoon winds shape the seasons and trading patterns in most of the Indian Ocean. Therefore, the continuity of the trade routes between East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and India in both maps indicate that sailors had learned to travel using monsoon winds.  ","(D) Incorrect. Although trade routes did often utilize sailors’ knowledge of longitude, this does not explain why trade routes remained the same over long periods of time given advancements in maritime technology.

Although the Ming dynasty made numerous maritime voyages into the Indian Ocean, including to the East African coast, these voyages did not sail around the cape of Africa nor did they establish long-term trading routes around the continent. Improved ship designs and navigational technologies allowed sailors to navigate around Africa, expanding trading routes.  ","(B) Incorrect. Although fishing remained an important way of making a living in the Indian Ocean, fishing was not an important factor in expanding long-distance trade routes. Long-distance trade in this period continued to involve primarily luxury or high-value goods. Improved ship designs and navigational technologies allowed sailors to navigate around Africa, expanding trading routes.  ","(C) Correct. Improved ship designs and navigational technologies brought on by European innovations to Arabic technologies allowed sailors to navigate around Africa, expanding trade routes.  ","(D) Incorrect. Although the Little Ice Age did create temperature changes in Europe and this may have affected European commercial production, this would not explain why trading routes expanded around Africa.

Map 2 depicts trades routes from both the east and west of Eurasia extending toward the Americas, connecting Eurasia to the American continents and indicating the existence of global trade routes.  ","(B) Incorrect. Although Map 2 does show extensive overland trade routes that extend through Africa and Eurasia, these trade routes do not connect to the Americas in any way and therefore do not indicate the creation of a global trading system. Map 2 depicts trades routes from both the east and west of Eurasia extending toward the Americas, connecting Eurasia to the American continents and indicating the existence of global trade routes.  ","(C) Incorrect. Although Mediterranean trade routes were crucial to cross-cultural contact through much of world history and these trading routes are shown on both Map 1 and Map 2, these trading routes are not linked directly to the Americas. Map 2 depicts trades routes from both the east and west of Eurasia extending toward the Americas, connecting Eurasia to the American continents and indicating the existence of global trade routes.  ","(D) Incorrect. Although the two maps show that India had long- distance trade connections with other regions continuously throughout the period circa 1250 to 1750, these trade connections were mostly through the overland Silk Roads and the maritime Indian Ocean trade network. While extensive, these networks were not truly global in reach because they did not include the Americas. The globalization of the world’s trade system in the period 1450-1750 is more clearly indicated on Map 2 by the appearance of trade networks linking Afro- Eurasia to the Americas.

While Asian economies like China began importing some globally produced crops, including corn, and regional, bulk trade in rice and other food stuffs was always a significant part of world trade, food imports were not a significant driver in growing world trade during the early modern period. Luxury goods like spices, silk and cotton cloth, and precious metals were the most significant trade goods, by volume and by value, that influenced the expansion of world trade during the early modern period.  ","(B) Correct. Luxury goods like spices, silk and cotton cloth, and precious metals were the most significant trade goods, by volume and by value, that influenced the expansion of world trade during the early modern period.  ","(C) Incorrect. While the Chinese participated in major naval expeditions during the early fifteenth century, and some Chinese merchants participated in trade in Southeast Asia, Chinese maritime trade was not significantly expanding during the early modern period.

The growth of Chinese commercial production and trade during the Song and Ming dynasties significantly contributed to the economic expansion in Asia. This was accompanied by similar growth in India as well.  ,"(B) Incorrect. While India experienced significant economic growth and was a major factor in the world economy between 1250 and 1750, the conquest of India by Muslim Turks and Afghans had very mixed economic effects. On the one hand the raids and conquests of northern India resulted in significant disruptions and damage. On the other hand, the conquest of India eventually connected India with the Muslim trading world and contributed to significant trade. But that occurred later than the original conquest. The growth of Chinese commercial production and trade during the Song and Ming dynasties significantly contributed to the economic expansion in Asia.  ","(C) Incorrect. While the Mongol world empire contributed to the growth of the world economy prior to the early modern period, it was not as directly connected to the importance of Asia in the world economy during the early modern period as Chinese commercialization under the Ming dynasty.
